# AK3918 Reference Documentation

This folder contains English summaries and structured notes extracted from the vendor PDFs stored under `downloaded/`. Start with `ak3918_reference_catalog.md` for an index of every source document, grouped by topic. Detailed notes live in subdirectories:

- `hardware/` – Board schematics, BOM highlights, mechanical guidance.
- `software/` – Vendor multimedia library APIs and integration notes.
- `system/` – SoC specifications, programmer guides, kernel manuals.
- `isp/` – Detailed block layout for `.conf` packs and sensor load scripts.
- `peripherals/` – Wi-Fi, Ethernet PHY, and accessory device references.
- `tools/` – Firmware packaging, integration guides, ISP tuning tool docs.
- `raw/` – Plain-text conversions of the original PDFs (for cross-checking translations).

Each markdown file links back to the original filename and lists concrete actions for the OpenIPC AK3918 runtime. Keep this directory updated when new documentation appears or when we refine translations.
