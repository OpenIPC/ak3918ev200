## English summary
Although targeting the Lamobo D1 (Allwinner-based), these guides offer practical insights into mechanical assembly, lens handling, and troubleshooting when working with small IP camera modules.

## Useful lessons for OpenIPC
- **Assembly**: Step-by-step photos for disassembling enclosure, routing flex cables, and securing sensor boards without damaging FPC connectors.
- **Lens replacement**: Techniques for adjusting focus after swapping lenses; recommends using focus charts and cautions about dust/IR filter handling.
- **Accessories**: Notes on optional night-vision boards, IR LED placement, and effect on thermals.

## Application
- Adopt similar mechanical handling steps when documenting Aimer39 sensor board swaps.
- Integrate focus calibration tips into future OpenIPC hardware guides.
- Highlight differences (different SoC) so readers use it only for mechanical reference.

## TODO
- Produce AK3918-specific photo guide once hardware access available, using Lamobo steps as template.
